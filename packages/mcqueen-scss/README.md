# @bolid/mcqueen-scss

This package contains the SCSS components of McQueen Design System.

## Installation

The package can be installed via npm:

```bash
npm i @bolid/mcqueen-scss --save
```

Or via yarn:

```bash
yarn add @bolid/mcqueen-scss
```

## Usage

You can import McQueen styles in JavaScript with this import:

```js
import '@bolid/mcqueen-scss/dist/styles.css';
```

That syntax is Webpack specific (and will work with Create React App), but you can use McQueen anywhere that supports ES6 module bundling and global CSS.
